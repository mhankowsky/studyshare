When clicking on a profile page, many users noted that it was weird to have the friends list on a profile suddenly pop up after a 5 second lag or so.  The reason behind this lag was because we were not appending the friends list div element to the doom until a response was received from our Facebook ajax request.  Instead, we added the div right away with a "loading" text so the user would know that it was waiting to receive the friends list.  This can be seen in the "loading_friends_list" screenshot in the after_feedback folder, as opposed to the "loading_profile" -> "profile" transition in the before_feedback folder.

It was also noted that there was no feedback given when the "Join Event" button is clicked.  This is because we were adding the user to the database in the backend, but not locally refreshing the DOM on the frontend until the user refreshed the page.  This was fixed by locally adding the user to the DOM when join_event button is clicked.  However, the poor feedback was compounded by confusion over when you could actually join an event.  Previously, you could join events that had already ended.  Furthermore, you could click the button, but nothing would actually happen if you had previously joined the event.  This was fixed by adding an error message that can be seen in the "already_ended" and "already_joined" screenshots in the after_feedback folder.

There were complaints that it was hard to read the date text (because of the font color), and the way the date was displayed was too formal (included the time zone offset and such).  This is visible in the "newsfeed" screenshot in before_feedback, and the new and improved "time_display" in after_feedback.

Clicking the "add class" button in the classes tab also gave no feedback, which users complained about.  The messages that are now shown can be seen in "already_joined_class" and "successfully_joined_class", in after_feedback.
