Our application is designed to allow the students of Carnegie Mellon to easier collaborate on studying for classes. This is done by allowing users to create study "events" which are displayed in the newsfeed of all users who share that class with the user. Users may join (and leave) study events, to signify their participation. Events include a time and a date, so users know exactly when and where to meet to study for a class. We hope that this application will make it easier for the students of Carnegie Mellon to meet new people in their classes, and use each other as resources for school work.

Our application is hosted on http://studyshare.res.cmu.edu:8889/
